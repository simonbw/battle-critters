==================
---- THE PLAN ----
==================

New Battle Page
	in python:
		webservice for getting critter info as JSON
		webservice for sending critter ids for user, random, recent, and search?
		
		have battle run in separate thread <== this might be hard
	in javascript:
		request critters from server
		parse returned JSON into objects
		cache objects by id
		list critters that are cached by some sort of sorting/filtering
